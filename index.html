        <p>
          And soon, the trees, oceans, and animals are all in trouble. 
          Global temperatures are rising, forests are burning down, and you're running out of clean air to live on.

        </h2>

        <p>
          Because of the decrease in emissions due to covid-19, governments are ignoring environmental issues without much resistance from the media and public.

          Despite the past climate marches and pressure from the public before covid-19, the Trump administration is reversing <u>100</u> rules and regulations protecting the environment.

          These regulations include:

        <p>
          If we don't act now, the sea levels will rise, the earth will start to flood, the arctic will melt, corals will start to bleach, animals will go extinct, and heat waves will get worse and worse. 
          Future generations will not get clean air, clean water, and humans will have a shorter lifespan.

          Hi, I'm Amy and I was inspired to make this website because of the state that the world will be in if we continue on this destructive path.
          The main excuse that governments use to ignore environmental concerns is the economy. But in the end, you can't eat wealth. You can't breathe wealth.
          I was also inspired by some of my trips to beautiful places. This photo was taken in Yellowstone National Park and it shows very well the beauty of the earth and what 
          our children will soon be missing out on.
